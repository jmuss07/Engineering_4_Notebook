## Launch Pad Part 1

### Assignment Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a countdown timer that goes down from 10 to 0. The value is meant to decrease by 1 every second. 

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

No wiring for this assignment! 

### Code

### Reflection

I felt pretty confident on this assignment, since I've used for-loops before. However, I had to look up how to change the increment by which it counts so that it goes backwards instead of fowards, since I needed a refresher. Other than that, I feel that the assignment went pretty well!

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
